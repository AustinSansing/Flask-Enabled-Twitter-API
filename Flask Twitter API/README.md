Flask backend and Twitter API Library 
This python script displays the tweets made by the entered twitter handle or desired hashtag on your browser.
Furthermore, you can also enter a sentence and get its overall emotion (sentiment analysis) using python's TextBlob library.
I further intend to implement sentiment analysis of tweets.

Features:
