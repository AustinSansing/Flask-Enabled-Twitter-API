# Tweepy-Flask
Flask backend and Twitter API Library (Tweepy)
This python script displays the tweets made by the entered twitter handle or desired hashtag on your browser.
Furthermore, you can also enter a sentence and get its overall emotion (sentiment analysis) using python's TextBlob library.
I further intend to implement sentiment analysis of tweets.

Features:

* You can get tweets by desired username

* You can get tweets which contain a particular word or phrase
* No need of loggin in
* Get the sentiment of the desired sentence in just one click!
